## What’s API Testing?
Process to detect if an api returns or receives valid data given a certain input.

## Why do we need API Testing?
Being a type of software that exposes certain methods and data to outside applications, they must be tested thorougly to ensure data is correctly served
and in a safe manner.

Examples of API errors:
* Incorrect routes
* Routes serving incorrect data
* Internal methods not prepared for certain inputs
* API not modifying needed data structures
